## Usage

First compile it, then run it.

# To compile

Compile all `.ts` files to `.js` by running
```
tsc
```
This will put corresponding `.js` files in `./compiled/`
-- and, strangely to me,
also put near-copies of all top-level `.js` files there.

# To run

Visit the `index.html` file in Firefox
(or presumably something else)
by pasting the path to the file into the URL bar.
